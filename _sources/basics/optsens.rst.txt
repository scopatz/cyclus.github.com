Optimization and Sensitivity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is an initial desire to minimize the direct simulation of institutional
decision making to seek optimal solutions.  Because institutional decision
making tends to seek an optimal solution only for the actor making that
decision (local optimization), it may not lead to an outcome that optimizes
for the largest population of stakeholders.  Instead, the fundamental approach
is to drive a single simulation with a large multi-dimensional data set and
then allow modern optimization technology to seek globally optimal solutions
based on global objective functions.

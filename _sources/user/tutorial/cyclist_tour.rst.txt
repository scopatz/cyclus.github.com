A Tour of the Cyclist User Interface
=====================================

The Cyclist user interface has four main areas:

* A **menu** bar, like many applications you have used in the past
* A **workspace** that currently has two modes:
    * Scenario Builder: to build a particular fuel cycle scenario
    * Data Exploration: to explore the output of a particular scenario or set of scnearios
* A set of **tools** that can be imported into the workspace
* A **message window** in which Cyclist may occasionally report updates.

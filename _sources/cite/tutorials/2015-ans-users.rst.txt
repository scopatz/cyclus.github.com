Cyclus is an advanced and flexible fuel cycle simulator capable of modeling
the long-term impacts of different nuclear fuel cycle options. Cyclus allows
users to arrange models of individual fuel cycle facilities into innovative
fuel cycle configurations. Cyclus and its graphical interfaces are freely
available. This tutorial will explore the fundamental concepts of Cyclus and
guide participants through the process of designing and analyzing a typical
nuclear fuel cycle. Participants should bring a laptop computer for the
